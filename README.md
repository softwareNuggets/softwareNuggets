Hey Team,

Welcome to my channel.  

I've been a software developer since 1990, and have written thousands of applications, scripts, 
nuggets, routines, etc.

This channel is dedicated to writing software nuggets (small pieces of code, functions, 
methods, routines, and even full apps) to transfer those skills to you.

My programming philosophy is to keep it simple, and always be learning.  I hope we share the love for coding and you'll use my channel to assist your advancement.  

Check out my videos, and if you like them enough please subscribe, and of course, share with your friends.

Okay team, enjoy my channel.
