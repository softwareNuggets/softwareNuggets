Hey Team,

Welcome to my channel.  

I've been a software developer since 1990, and have written thousands of applications, scripts, 
nuggets, routines, etc.

This channel is dedicated to writing software nuggets (small pieces of code, functions, 
methods, routines, and even full apps) to transfer those skills to you.

Check out my videos, and if you like them enough please subscribe, and of course, share with your friends.

Okay team, enjoy my channel.
